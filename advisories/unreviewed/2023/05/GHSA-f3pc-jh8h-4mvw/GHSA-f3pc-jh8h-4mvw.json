  "details": "\nDell NetWorker 19.6.1.2, contains an OS command injection Vulnerability in the NetWorker client. A remote unauthenticated attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS, with the privileges of the vulnerable application. This is a high severity vulnerability as the exploitation allows an attacker to take complete control of a system, so Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.\n\n",
