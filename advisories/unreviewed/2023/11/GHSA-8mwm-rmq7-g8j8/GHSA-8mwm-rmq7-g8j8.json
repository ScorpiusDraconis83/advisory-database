  "details": "The Debug Log Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clear_log() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the debug log via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
