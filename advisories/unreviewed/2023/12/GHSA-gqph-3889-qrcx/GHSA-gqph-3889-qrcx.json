  "details": "InteraXon Muse 2 devices allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect Muse App report of an outstanding, calm meditation state) via a 480 MHz RF carrier that is modulated by a \"false\" brain wave, aka a Brain-Hack attack. For example, the Muse App does not display the reception of a strong RF carrier, and alert the user that a report may be misleading if this carrier has been modulated by a low-frequency signal.",
