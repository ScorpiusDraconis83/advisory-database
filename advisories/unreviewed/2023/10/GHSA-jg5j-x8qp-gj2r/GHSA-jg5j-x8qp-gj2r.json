  "details": "The AI ChatBot plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in version 4.9.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the corresponding functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke those functions via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
