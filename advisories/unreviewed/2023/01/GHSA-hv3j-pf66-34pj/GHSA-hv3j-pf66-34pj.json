  ],
  "details": "A vulnerability in class-of-service (CoS) queue management in Juniper Networks Junos OS on the ACX2K Series devices allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Specific packets are being incorrectly routed to a queue used for other high-priority traffic such as BGP, PIM, ICMP, ICMPV6 ND and ISAKMP. Due to this misclassification of traffic, receipt of a high rate of these specific packets will cause delays in the processing of other traffic, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on ACX2K Series: All versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; All 20.2 versions; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S6 on ACX2K Series; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4 on ACX2K Series; All 21.1 versions; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S3 on ACX2K Series. Note: This issues affects legacy ACX2K Series PPC-based devices. This platform reached Last Supported Version (LSV) as of the Junos OS 21.2 Release.",
