  "details": "A vulnerability in the CryptoService function of Cisco Duo Device Health Application for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker with low privileges to conduct directory traversal attacks and overwrite arbitrary files on an affected system.\n\n This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing a directory traversal attack on an affected host. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to use a cryptographic key to overwrite arbitrary files with SYSTEM-level privileges, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition or data loss on the affected system.",
