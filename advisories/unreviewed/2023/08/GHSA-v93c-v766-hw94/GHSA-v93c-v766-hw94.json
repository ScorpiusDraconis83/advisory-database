  "details": "The WP Directory Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'admin_page_display' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or change plugin settings, import demo data, modify or delete Directory Kit related posts and terms via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. Partial patches were made avilable in versions 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 but the issue was not fully patched until 1.2.2",
