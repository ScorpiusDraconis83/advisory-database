  "details": "Code Dx versions prior to 2023.4.2 are vulnerable to user impersonation attack where a malicious actor is able to gain access to another user's account by crafting a custom \"Remember Me\" token. This is possible due to the use of a hard-coded cipher which was used when generating the token. A malicious actor who creates this token can supply it to a separate Code Dx system, provided they know the username they want to impersonate, and impersonate the user.  Score 6.7 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C\n\n",
