  "details": "A vulnerability in the Wireless Network Control daemon (wncd) of Cisco IOS XE Software for Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\n\n This vulnerability is due to improper memory management. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of network requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the wncd process to consume available memory and eventually cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.",
