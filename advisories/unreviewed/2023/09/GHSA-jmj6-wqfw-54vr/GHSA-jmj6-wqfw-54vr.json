  ],
  "details": "A SQL injection in the flutter_downloader component through 1.11.1 for iOS allows remote attackers to steal session tokens and overwrite arbitrary files inside the app's container. The internal database of the framework is exposed to the local user if an app uses UIFileSharingEnabled and LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace properties. As a result, local users can obtain the same attack primitives as remote attackers by tampering with the internal database of the framework on the device.",
