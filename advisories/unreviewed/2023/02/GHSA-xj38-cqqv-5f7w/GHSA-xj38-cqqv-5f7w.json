  "details": "A vulnerability in the backup configuration feature of Cisco UCS Manager Software and in the configuration export feature of Cisco FXOS Software could allow an unauthenticated attacker with access to a backup file to decrypt sensitive information stored in the full state and configuration backup files. This vulnerability is due to a weakness in the encryption method used for the backup function. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by leveraging a static key used for the backup configuration feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive information that is stored in full state and configuration backup files, such as local user credentials, authentication server passwords, Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community names, and other credentials.",
