  "details": "Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. \n\nStarting with the 9.1 branch, Grafana introduced the ability to search for a JWT in the URL query parameter auth_token and use it as the authentication token. \n\nBy enabling the \"url_login\" configuration option (disabled by default), a JWT might be sent to data sources. If an attacker has access to the data source, the leaked token could be used to authenticate to Grafana.",
