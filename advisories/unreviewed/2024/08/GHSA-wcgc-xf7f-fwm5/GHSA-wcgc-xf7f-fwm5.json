  "details": "An application can be configured to block boot attempts after consecutive tamper resets are detected, which may not occur as expected.\n\nThis is possible because the TAMPERRSTCAUSE register may not be properly updated when a level 4 tamper event (a tamper reset) occurs. This impacts Series 2 HSE-SVH devices, including xG23B, xG24B, xG25B, and xG28B, but does not impact xG21B. To mitigate this issue, upgrade to SE Firmware version 2.2.6 or later.",
