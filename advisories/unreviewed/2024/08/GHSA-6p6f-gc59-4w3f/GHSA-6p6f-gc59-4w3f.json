  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nmm: fix crashes from deferred split racing folio migration\n\nEven on 6.10-rc6, I've been seeing elusive \"Bad page state\"s (often on\nflags when freeing, yet the flags shown are not bad: PG_locked had been\nset and cleared??), and VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(page_ref_count(page) == 0)s from\ndeferred_split_scan()'s folio_put(), and a variety of other BUG and WARN\nsymptoms implying double free by deferred split and large folio migration.\n\n6.7 commit 9bcef5973e31 (\"mm: memcg: fix split queue list crash when large\nfolio migration\") was right to fix the memcg-dependent locking broken in\n85ce2c517ade (\"memcontrol: only transfer the memcg data for migration\"),\nbut missed a subtlety of deferred_split_scan(): it moves folios to its own\nlocal list to work on them without split_queue_lock, during which time\nfolio->_deferred_list is not empty, but even the \"right\" lock does nothing\nto secure the folio and the list it is on.\n\nFortunately, deferred_split_scan() is careful to use folio_try_get(): so\nfolio_migrate_mapping() can avoid the race by folio_undo_large_rmappable()\nwhile the old folio's reference count is temporarily frozen to 0 - adding\nsuch a freeze in the !mapping case too (originally, folio lock and\nunmapping and no swap cache left an anon folio unreachable, so no freezing\nwas needed there: but the deferred split queue offers a way to reach it).",
