  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nwatchdog: cpu5wdt.c: Fix use-after-free bug caused by cpu5wdt_trigger\n\nWhen the cpu5wdt module is removing, the origin code uses del_timer() to\nde-activate the timer. If the timer handler is running, del_timer() could\nnot stop it and will return directly. If the port region is released by\nrelease_region() and then the timer handler cpu5wdt_trigger() calls outb()\nto write into the region that is released, the use-after-free bug will\nhappen.\n\nChange del_timer() to timer_shutdown_sync() in order that the timer handler\ncould be finished before the port region is released.",
