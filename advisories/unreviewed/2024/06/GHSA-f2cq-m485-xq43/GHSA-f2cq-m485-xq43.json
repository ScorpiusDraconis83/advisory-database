  ],
  "details": "An attacker with access to the private network (the charger is connected to) or local access to the Ethernet-Interface can exploit a faulty implementation of the JWT-library in order to bypass the password authentication to the web configuration interface and then has full access as the user would have. However, an attacker will not have developer or admin rights. If the implementation of the JWT-library is wrongly configured to accept \"none\"-algorithms, the server will pass insecure JWT. A local, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the authentication mechanism.",
