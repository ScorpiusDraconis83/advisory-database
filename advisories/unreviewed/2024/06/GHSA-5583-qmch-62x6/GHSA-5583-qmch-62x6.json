  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nvduse: check that offset is within bounds in get_config()\n\nThis condition checks \"len\" but it does not check \"offset\" and that\ncould result in an out of bounds read if \"offset > dev->config_size\".\nThe problem is that since both variables are unsigned the\n\"dev->config_size - offset\" subtraction would result in a very high\nunsigned value.\n\nI think these checks might not be necessary because \"len\" and \"offset\"\nare supposed to already have been validated using the\nvhost_vdpa_config_validate() function.  But I do not know the code\nperfectly, and I like to be safe.",
