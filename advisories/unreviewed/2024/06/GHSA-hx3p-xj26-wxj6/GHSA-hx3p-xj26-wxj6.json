  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfpga: bridge: add owner module and take its refcount\n\nThe current implementation of the fpga bridge assumes that the low-level\nmodule registers a driver for the parent device and uses its owner pointer\nto take the module's refcount. This approach is problematic since it can\nlead to a null pointer dereference while attempting to get the bridge if\nthe parent device does not have a driver.\n\nTo address this problem, add a module owner pointer to the fpga_bridge\nstruct and use it to take the module's refcount. Modify the function for\nregistering a bridge to take an additional owner module parameter and\nrename it to avoid conflicts. Use the old function name for a helper macro\nthat automatically sets the module that registers the bridge as the owner.\nThis ensures compatibility with existing low-level control modules and\nreduces the chances of registering a bridge without setting the owner.\n\nAlso, update the documentation to keep it consistent with the new interface\nfor registering an fpga bridge.\n\nOther changes: opportunistically move put_device() from __fpga_bridge_get()\nto fpga_bridge_get() and of_fpga_bridge_get() to improve code clarity since\nthe bridge device is taken in these functions.",
