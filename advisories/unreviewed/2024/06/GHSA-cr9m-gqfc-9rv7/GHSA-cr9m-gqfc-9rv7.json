  "details": "The WP Recipe Maker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's [wprm-recipe-instructions] and [wprm-recipe-ingredients] shortcodes in all versions up to, and including, 9.1.0 due to insufficient restrictions on the 'group_tag' attribute . This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.",
