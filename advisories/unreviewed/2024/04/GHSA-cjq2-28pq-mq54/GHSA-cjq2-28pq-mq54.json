  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface.\n\n This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to visit specific web pages that include malicious payloads. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.",
