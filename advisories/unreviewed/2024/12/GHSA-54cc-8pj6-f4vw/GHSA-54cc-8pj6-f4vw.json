  "details": "The The Pojo Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution via form_preview_shortcode AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.7. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes. This was partially fixed in version 1.4.8.",
