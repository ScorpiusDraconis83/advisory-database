  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nerofs: handle NONHEAD !delta[1] lclusters gracefully\n\nsyzbot reported a WARNING in iomap_iter_done:\n iomap_fiemap+0x73b/0x9b0 fs/iomap/fiemap.c:80\n ioctl_fiemap fs/ioctl.c:220 [inline]\n\nGenerally, NONHEAD lclusters won't have delta[1]==0, except for crafted\nimages and filesystems created by pre-1.0 mkfs versions.\n\nPreviously, it would immediately bail out if delta[1]==0, which led to\ninadequate decompressed lengths (thus FIEMAP is impacted).  Treat it as\ndelta[1]=1 to work around these legacy mkfs versions.\n\n`lclusterbits > 14` is illegal for compact indexes, error out too.",
