  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: sync_linked_regs() must preserve subreg_def\n\nRange propagation must not affect subreg_def marks, otherwise the\nfollowing example is rewritten by verifier incorrectly when\nBPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag is set:\n\n  0: call bpf_ktime_get_ns                   call bpf_ktime_get_ns\n  1: r0 &= 0x7fffffff       after verifier   r0 &= 0x7fffffff\n  2: w1 = w0                rewrites         w1 = w0\n  3: if w0 < 10 goto +0     -------------->  r11 = 0x2f5674a6     (r)\n  4: r1 >>= 32                               r11 <<= 32           (r)\n  5: r0 = r1                                 r1 |= r11            (r)\n  6: exit;                                   if w0 < 0xa goto pc+0\n                                             r1 >>= 32\n                                             r0 = r1\n                                             exit\n\n(or zero extension of w1 at (2) is missing for architectures that\n require zero extension for upper register half).\n\nThe following happens w/o this patch:\n- r0 is marked as not a subreg at (0);\n- w1 is marked as subreg at (2);\n- w1 subreg_def is overridden at (3) by copy_register_state();\n- w1 is read at (5) but mark_insn_zext() does not mark (2)\n  for zero extension, because w1 subreg_def is not set;\n- because of BPF_F_TEST_RND_HI32 flag verifier inserts random\n  value for hi32 bits of (2) (marked (r));\n- this random value is read at (5).",
