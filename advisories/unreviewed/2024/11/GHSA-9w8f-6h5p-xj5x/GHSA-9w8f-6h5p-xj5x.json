  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ni40e: fix race condition by adding filter's intermediate sync state\n\nFix a race condition in the i40e driver that leads to MAC/VLAN filters\nbecoming corrupted and leaking. Address the issue that occurs under\nheavy load when multiple threads are concurrently modifying MAC/VLAN\nfilters by setting mac and port VLAN.\n\n1. Thread T0 allocates a filter in i40e_add_filter() within\n        i40e_ndo_set_vf_port_vlan().\n2. Thread T1 concurrently frees the filter in __i40e_del_filter() within\n        i40e_ndo_set_vf_mac().\n3. Subsequently, i40e_service_task() calls i40e_sync_vsi_filters(), which\n        refers to the already freed filter memory, causing corruption.\n\nReproduction steps:\n1. Spawn multiple VFs.\n2. Apply a concurrent heavy load by running parallel operations to change\n        MAC addresses on the VFs and change port VLANs on the host.\n3. Observe errors in dmesg:\n\"Error I40E_AQ_RC_ENOSPC adding RX filters on VF XX,\n\tplease set promiscuous on manually for VF XX\".\n\nExact code for stable reproduction Intel can't open-source now.\n\nThe fix involves implementing a new intermediate filter state,\nI40E_FILTER_NEW_SYNC, for the time when a filter is on a tmp_add_list.\nThese filters cannot be deleted from the hash list directly but\nmust be removed using the full process.",
