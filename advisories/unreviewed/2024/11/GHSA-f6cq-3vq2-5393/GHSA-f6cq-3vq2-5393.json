  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Make sure internal and UAPI bpf_redirect flags don't overlap\n\nThe bpf_redirect_info is shared between the SKB and XDP redirect paths,\nand the two paths use the same numeric flag values in the ri->flags\nfield (specifically, BPF_F_BROADCAST == BPF_F_NEXTHOP). This means that\nif skb bpf_redirect_neigh() is used with a non-NULL params argument and,\nsubsequently, an XDP redirect is performed using the same\nbpf_redirect_info struct, the XDP path will get confused and end up\ncrashing, which syzbot managed to trigger.\n\nWith the stack-allocated bpf_redirect_info, the structure is no longer\nshared between the SKB and XDP paths, so the crash doesn't happen\nanymore. However, different code paths using identically-numbered flag\nvalues in the same struct field still seems like a bit of a mess, so\nthis patch cleans that up by moving the flag definitions together and\nredefining the three flags in BPF_F_REDIRECT_INTERNAL to not overlap\nwith the flags used for XDP. It also adds a BUILD_BUG_ON() check to make\nsure the overlap is not re-introduced by mistake.",
