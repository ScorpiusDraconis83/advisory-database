  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nfirewire: core: fix invalid port index for parent device\n\nIn a commit 24b7f8e5cd65 (\"firewire: core: use helper functions for self\nID sequence\"), the enumeration over self ID sequence was refactored with\nsome helper functions with KUnit tests. These helper functions are\nguaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application\nincludes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected\nto parent device.\n\nThis bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or\nmore ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path\nto update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protection\nfault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.\n\nThis commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index.",
