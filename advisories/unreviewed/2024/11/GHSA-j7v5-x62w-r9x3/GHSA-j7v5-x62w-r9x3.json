  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/panthor: Fix race when converting group handle to group object\n\nXArray provides it's own internal lock which protects the internal array\nwhen entries are being simultaneously added and removed. However there\nis still a race between retrieving the pointer from the XArray and\nincrementing the reference count.\n\nTo avoid this race simply hold the internal XArray lock when\nincrementing the reference count, this ensures there cannot be a racing\ncall to xa_erase().",
