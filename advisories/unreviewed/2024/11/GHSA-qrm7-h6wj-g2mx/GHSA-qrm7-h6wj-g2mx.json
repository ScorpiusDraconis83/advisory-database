This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Allegra. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the product implements a registration mechanism that can be used to create a new user with a sufficient privilege level.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the getFileContentAsString method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-22530.",
