  "details": "A NoSQL injection vulnerability in Adapt Learning Adapt Authoring Tool <= 0.11.3 allows unauthenticated attackers to reset user and administrator account passwords via the \"Reset password\" feature. The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation of user input, which is used as a query in Mongoose's find() function. This makes it possible for attackers to perform a full takeover of the administrator account. Attackers can then use the newly gained administrative privileges to upload a custom plugin to perform remote code execution (RCE) on the server hosting the web application.",
