  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: fec: don't save PTP state if PTP is unsupported\n\nSome platforms (such as i.MX25 and i.MX27) do not support PTP, so on\nthese platforms fec_ptp_init() is not called and the related members\nin fep are not initialized. However, fec_ptp_save_state() is called\nunconditionally, which causes the kernel to panic. Therefore, add a\ncondition so that fec_ptp_save_state() is not called if PTP is not\nsupported.",
