  "details": "A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `/api/v1/external-users` route of lunary-ai/lunary version v1.4.2. The `order by` clause of the SQL query uses `sql.unsafe` without prior sanitization, allowing for SQL injection. The `orderByClause` variable is constructed without server-side validation or sanitization, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Successful exploitation can lead to complete data loss, modification, or corruption.",
