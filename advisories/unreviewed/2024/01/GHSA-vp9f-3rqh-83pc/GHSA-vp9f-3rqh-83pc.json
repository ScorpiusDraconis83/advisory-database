  "details": "The C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Splashtop\\Splashtop Software Updater\\uninst.exe process creates a folder at C:\\Windows\\Temp~nsu.tmp and copies itself to it as Au_.exe. The C:\\Windows\\Temp~nsu.tmp\\Au_.exe file is automatically launched as SYSTEM when the system reboots or when a standard user runs an MSI repair using Splashtop Streamerâ€™s Windows Installer. Since the C:\\Windows\\Temp~nsu.tmp folder inherits permissions from C:\\Windows\\Temp and Au_.exe is susceptible to DLL hijacking, standard users can write a malicious DLL to it and elevate their privileges.",
