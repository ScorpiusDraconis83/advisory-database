  ],
  "details": "The Formidable Forms â€“ Contact Form, Survey, Quiz, Payment, Calculator Form & Custom Form Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the name field label and description field label parameter in all versions up to 6.7 (inclusive) due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default, this only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled. However, in the formidable settings admins can extend form creation, deletion and other management permissions to other user types, which makes it possible for this vulnerability to be exploited by lower level user types as long as they have been granted the proper permissions.",
