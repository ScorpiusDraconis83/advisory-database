  "details": "The LearnPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Command Injection in all versions up to, and including, 4.2.5.7 via the get_content function. This is due to the plugin making use of the call_user_func function with user input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute any public function with one parameter, which could result in remote code execution.",
