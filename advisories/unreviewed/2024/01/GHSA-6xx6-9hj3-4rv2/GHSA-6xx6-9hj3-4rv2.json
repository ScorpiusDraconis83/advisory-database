  ],
  "details": "A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8 bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of the previous element, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.",
