  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet/tls: Fix use-after-free after the TLS device goes down and up\n\nWhen a netdev with active TLS offload goes down, tls_device_down is\ncalled to stop the offload and tear down the TLS context. However, the\nsocket stays alive, and it still points to the TLS context, which is now\ndeallocated. If a netdev goes up, while the connection is still active,\nand the data flow resumes after a number of TCP retransmissions, it will\nlead to a use-after-free of the TLS context.\n\nThis commit addresses this bug by keeping the context alive until its\nnormal destruction, and implements the necessary fallbacks, so that the\nconnection can resume in software (non-offloaded) kTLS mode.\n\nOn the TX side tls_sw_fallback is used to encrypt all packets. The RX\nside already has all the necessary fallbacks, because receiving\nnon-decrypted packets is supported. The thing needed on the RX side is\nto block resync requests, which are normally produced after receiving\nnon-decrypted packets.\n\nThe necessary synchronization is implemented for a graceful teardown:\nfirst the fallbacks are deployed, then the driver resources are released\n(it used to be possible to have a tls_dev_resync after tls_dev_del).\n\nA new flag called TLS_RX_DEV_DEGRADED is added to indicate the fallback\nmode. It's used to skip the RX resync logic completely, as it becomes\nuseless, and some objects may be released (for example, resync_async,\nwhich is allocated and freed by the driver).",
