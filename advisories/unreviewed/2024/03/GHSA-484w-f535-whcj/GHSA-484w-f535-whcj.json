  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbtrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item\n\nInstead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index item\ninto the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the resources we\nhave allocated/acquired before and return the error to the caller. This is\nfine because all existing call chains undo anything they have done before\ncalling btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending\nsnapshots in the transaction commit path).\n\nSo remove the BUG() call and do proper error handling.\n\nThis relates to a syzbot report linked below, but does not fix it because\nit only prevents hitting a BUG(), it does not fix the issue where somehow\nwe attempt to use twice the same index number for different index items.",
