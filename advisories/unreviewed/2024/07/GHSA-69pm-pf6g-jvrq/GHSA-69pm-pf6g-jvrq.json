  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nice: Fix KASAN error in LAG NETDEV_UNREGISTER handler\n\nCurrently, the same handler is called for both a NETDEV_BONDING_INFO\nLAG unlink notification as for a NETDEV_UNREGISTER call.  This is\ncausing a problem though, since the netdev_notifier_info passed has\na different structure depending on which event is passed.  The problem\nmanifests as a call trace from a BUG: KASAN stack-out-of-bounds error.\n\nFix this by creating a handler specific to NETDEV_UNREGISTER that only\nis passed valid elements in the netdev_notifier_info struct for the\nNETDEV_UNREGISTER event.\n\nAlso included is the removal of an unbalanced dev_put on the peer_netdev\nand related braces.",
