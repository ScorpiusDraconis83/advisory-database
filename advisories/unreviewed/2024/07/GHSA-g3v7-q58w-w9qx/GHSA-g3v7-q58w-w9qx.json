  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: rswitch: Avoid use-after-free in rswitch_poll()\n\nThe use-after-free is actually in rswitch_tx_free(), which is inlined in\nrswitch_poll(). Since `skb` and `gq->skbs[gq->dirty]` are in fact the\nsame pointer, the skb is first freed using dev_kfree_skb_any(), then the\nvalue in skb->len is used to update the interface statistics.\n\nLet's move around the instructions to use skb->len before the skb is\nfreed.\n\nThis bug is trivial to reproduce using KFENCE. It will trigger a splat\nevery few packets. A simple ARP request or ICMP echo request is enough.",
