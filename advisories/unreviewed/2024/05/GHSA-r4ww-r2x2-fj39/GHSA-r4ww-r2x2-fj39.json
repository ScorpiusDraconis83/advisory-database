  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nx86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD\n\nCommit 672365477ae8 (\"x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required\") and\ncommit 8bf26758ca96 (\"x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate\") introduced a\nper CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in\norder to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.\n\nOn CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which\nwipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not\nreset, which brings them out of sync.\n\nAs a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update\nthe MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel\nspace, which crashes the kernel.\n\nTo fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together\nwith MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.",
