  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mctp: take ownership of skb in mctp_local_output\n\nCurrently, mctp_local_output only takes ownership of skb on success, and\nwe may leak an skb if mctp_local_output fails in specific states; the\nskb ownership isn't transferred until the actual output routing occurs.\n\nInstead, make mctp_local_output free the skb on all error paths up to\nthe route action, so it always consumes the passed skb.",
