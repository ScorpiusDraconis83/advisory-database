  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ncpumap: Zero-initialise xdp_rxq_info struct before running XDP program\n\nWhen running an XDP program that is attached to a cpumap entry, we don't\ninitialise the xdp_rxq_info data structure being used in the xdp_buff\nthat backs the XDP program invocation. Tobias noticed that this leads to\nrandom values being returned as the xdp_md->rx_queue_index value for XDP\nprograms running in a cpumap.\n\nThis means we're basically returning the contents of the uninitialised\nmemory, which is bad. Fix this by zero-initialising the rxq data\nstructure before running the XDP program.",
