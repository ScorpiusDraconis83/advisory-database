  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nxen/evtchn: avoid WARN() when unbinding an event channel\n\nWhen unbinding a user event channel, the related handler might be\ncalled a last time in case the kernel was built with\nCONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ. This might cause a WARN() in the handler.\n\nAvoid that by adding an \"unbinding\" flag to struct user_event which\nwill short circuit the handler.",
