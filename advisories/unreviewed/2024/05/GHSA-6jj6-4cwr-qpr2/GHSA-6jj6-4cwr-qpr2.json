  "details": "An issue was discovered in Alcatel-Lucent ALE NOE deskphones through 86x8_NOE-R300.1.40.12.4180 and SIP deskphones through 86x8_SIP-R200.1.01.10.728. Because of improper privilege management, an authenticated attacker is able to create symlinks to sensitive and protected data in locations that are used for debugging files. Given that the process of gathering debug logs is carried out with root privileges, any file referenced in the symlink is consequently written to the debug archive, thereby granting accessibility to the attacker.",
