  "details": "A path traversal vulnerability in the '/apply_settings' endpoint of parisneo/lollms-webui allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the configuration settings, specifically within the 'extensions' parameter. Attackers can exploit this by crafting a payload that includes relative path traversal sequences ('../../../'), enabling them to navigate to arbitrary directories. This flaw subsequently allows the server to load and execute a malicious '__init__.py' file, leading to remote code execution. The issue affects the latest version of parisneo/lollms-webui.",
