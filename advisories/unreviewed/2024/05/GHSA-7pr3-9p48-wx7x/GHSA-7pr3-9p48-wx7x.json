  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ns390/decompressor: specify __decompress() buf len to avoid overflow\n\nHistorically calls to __decompress() didn't specify \"out_len\" parameter\non many architectures including s390, expecting that no writes beyond\nuncompressed kernel image are performed. This has changed since commit\n2aa14b1ab2c4 (\"zstd: import usptream v1.5.2\") which includes zstd library\ncommit 6a7ede3dfccb (\"Reduce size of dctx by reutilizing dst buffer\n(#2751)\"). Now zstd decompression code might store literal buffer in\nthe unwritten portion of the destination buffer. Since \"out_len\" is\nnot set, it is considered to be unlimited and hence free to use for\noptimization needs. On s390 this might corrupt initrd or ipl report\nwhich are often placed right after the decompressor buffer. Luckily the\nsize of uncompressed kernel image is already known to the decompressor,\nso to avoid the problem simply specify it in the \"out_len\" parameter.",
