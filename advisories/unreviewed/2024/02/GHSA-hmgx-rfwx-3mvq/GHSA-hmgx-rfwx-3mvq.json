  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nperf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() call\n\nCurrently, the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though\nits result is used only if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set in\nattr.sample_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM,\nit causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook implementation.\n\nSELinux implements the locked_down hook with a check whether the current\ntask's type has the corresponding \"lockdown\" class permission\n(\"integrity\" or \"confidentiality\") allowed in the policy. This means\nthat calling the hook when the access control decision would be ignored\ngenerates a bogus permission check and audit record.\n\nFix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hook when\nits result would be honored.",
