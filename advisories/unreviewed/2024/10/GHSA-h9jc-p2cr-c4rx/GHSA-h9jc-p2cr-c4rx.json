  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nl2tp: prevent possible tunnel refcount underflow\n\nWhen a session is created, it sets a backpointer to its tunnel. When\nthe session refcount drops to 0, l2tp_session_free drops the tunnel\nrefcount if session->tunnel is non-NULL. However, session->tunnel is\nset in l2tp_session_create, before the tunnel refcount is incremented\nby l2tp_session_register, which leaves a small window where\nsession->tunnel is non-NULL when the tunnel refcount hasn't been\nbumped.\n\nMoving the assignment to l2tp_session_register is trivial but\nl2tp_session_create calls l2tp_session_set_header_len which uses\nsession->tunnel to get the tunnel's encap. Add an encap arg to\nl2tp_session_set_header_len to avoid using session->tunnel.\n\nIf l2tpv3 sessions have colliding IDs, it is possible for\nl2tp_v3_session_get to race with l2tp_session_register and fetch a\nsession which doesn't yet have session->tunnel set. Add a check for\nthis case.",
