  "details": "A security flaw involving hard-coded credentials in LevelOne WBR-6012's web services allows attackers to gain unauthorized access during the first 30 seconds post-boot. Other vulnerabilities can force a reboot, circumventing the initial time restriction for exploitation.The password string can be found at addresses 0x 803cdd0f and 0x803da3e6:\n\n    803cdd0f 41 72 69 65        ds         \"AriesSerenaCairryNativitaMegan\"\n             73 53 65 72 \n             65 6e 61 43\n             ...\n\nIt is referenced by the function at 0x800b78b0 and simplified in the pseudocode below:\n\n    if (is_equal = strcmp(password,\"AriesSerenaCairryNativitaMegan\"){\n        ret = 3;}\n\nWhere 3 is the return value to user-level access (0 being fail and 1 being admin/backdoor).\n\nWhile there's no legitimate functionality to change this password, once authenticated it is possible manually make a change by taking advantage of TALOS-2024-XXXXX using HTTP POST paramater \"Pu\" (new user password) in place of \"Pa\" (new admin password).",
