  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndrm/amd/display: Avoid overflow assignment in link_dp_cts\n\nsampling_rate is an uint8_t but is assigned an unsigned int, and thus it\ncan overflow. As a result, sampling_rate is changed to uint32_t.\n\nSimilarly, LINK_QUAL_PATTERN_SET has a size of 2 bits, and it should\nonly be assigned to a value less or equal than 4.\n\nThis fixes 2 INTEGER_OVERFLOW issues reported by Coverity.",
