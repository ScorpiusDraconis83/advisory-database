  "details": "A vulnerability in the VPN and management web servers of the Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv) and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv), formerly Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Virtual, platforms could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the virtual devices to run out of system memory, which could cause SSL VPN connection processing to slow down and eventually cease all together.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to a lack of proper memory management for new incoming SSL/TLS connections on the virtual platforms. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of new incoming SSL/TLS connections to the targeted virtual platform. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to deplete system memory,&nbsp;resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The memory could be reclaimed slowly if the attack traffic is stopped, but a manual reload may be required to restore operations quickly.",
