  "details": "An issue was discovered on certain GL-iNet devices, including MT6000, MT3000, MT2500, AXT1800, and AX1800 4.6.2. The SID generated for a specific user is not tied to that user itself, which allows other users to potentially use it for authentication. Once an attacker bypasses the application's authentication procedures, they can generate a valid SID, escalate privileges, and gain full control.",
