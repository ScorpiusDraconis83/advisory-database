  "details": "A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus Dashboard Fabric Controller (NDFC), formerly Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM), could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with network-admin privileges to perform a command injection attack against an affected device.\n&nbsp;\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of command arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted command arguments to a specific REST API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite sensitive files or crash a specific container, which would restart on its own, causing a low-impact denial of service (DoS) condition.",
