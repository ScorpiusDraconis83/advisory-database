  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnet: mana: Fix race on per-CQ variable napi work_done\n\nAfter calling napi_complete_done(), the NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit may be\ncleared, and another CPU can start napi thread and access per-CQ variable,\ncq->work_done. If the other thread (for example, from busy_poll) sets\nit to a value >= budget, this thread will continue to run when it should\nstop, and cause memory corruption and panic.\n\nTo fix this issue, save the per-CQ work_done variable in a local variable\nbefore napi_complete_done(), so it won't be corrupted by a possible\nconcurrent thread after napi_complete_done().\n\nAlso, add a flag bit to advertise to the NIC firmware: the NAPI work_done\nvariable race is fixed, so the driver is able to reliably support features\nlike busy_poll.",
