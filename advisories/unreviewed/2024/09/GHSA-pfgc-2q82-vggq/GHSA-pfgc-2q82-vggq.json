  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict in presence of third party lease\n\nIt is not safe to dereference fl->c.flc_owner without first confirming\nfl->fl_lmops is the expected manager.  nfsd4_deleg_getattr_conflict()\ntests fl_lmops but largely ignores the result and assumes that flc_owner\nis an nfs4_delegation anyway.  This is wrong.\n\nWith this patch we restore the \"!= &nfsd_lease_mng_ops\" case to behave\nas it did before the change mentioned below.  This is the same as the\ncurrent code, but without any reference to a possible delegation.",
