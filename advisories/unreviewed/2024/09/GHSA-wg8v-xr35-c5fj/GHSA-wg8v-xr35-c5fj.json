  "details": "Entrust Instant Financial Issuance (formerly known as Cardwizard) 6.10.0, 6.9.0, 6.9.1, 6.9.2, and 6.8.x and earlier uses a DLL library (i.e. DCG.Security.dll) with a custom AES encryption process that relies on static hard-coded key values. These keys are not uniquely generated per installation of the software. Combined with the encrypted password that can be obtained from \"WebAPI.cfg.xml\" in CVE-2024-39341, the decryption is trivial and can lead to privilege escalation on the Windows host.",
