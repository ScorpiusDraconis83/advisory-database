  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nbpf: Remove tst_run from lwt_seg6local_prog_ops.\n\nThe syzbot reported that the lwt_seg6 related BPF ops can be invoked\nvia bpf_test_run() without without entering input_action_end_bpf()\nfirst.\n\nMartin KaFai Lau said that self test for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL\nprobably didn't work since it was introduced in commit 04d4b274e2a\n(\"ipv6: sr: Add seg6local action End.BPF\"). The reason is that the\nper-CPU variable seg6_bpf_srh_states::srh is never assigned in the self\ntest case but each BPF function expects it.\n\nRemove test_run for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_SEG6LOCAL.",
