  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\ndlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereference\n\nThis patch fixes a possible null pointer dereference when this function is\ncalled from request_lock() as lkb->lkb_resource is not assigned yet,\nonly after validate_lock_args() by calling attach_lkb(). Another issue\nis that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannot\nassume to be ASCII coded.\n\nThe log functionality is probably never being hit when DLM is used in\nnormal way and no debug logging is enabled. The null pointer dereference\ncan only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resource\nassigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but we\nshould be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and we\nactually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.\n\nIn this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb id\nis enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if this\nexists.",
