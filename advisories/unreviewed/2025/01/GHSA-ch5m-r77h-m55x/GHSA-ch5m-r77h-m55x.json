  "details": "The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 5.1.8. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to logging them in as that user. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to authenticate as any user as long as they have configured OTP login by phone number.",
