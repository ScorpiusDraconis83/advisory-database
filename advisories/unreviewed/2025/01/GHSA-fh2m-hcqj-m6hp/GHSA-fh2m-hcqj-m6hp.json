  "details": "The Variation Swatches for WooCommerce plugin, in all versions starting at 1.0.8 up until 1.3.2, contains a vulnerability due to improper nonce verification in its settings reset functionality. The issue exists in the settings_init() function, which processes a reset action based on specific query parameters in the URL. The related delete_settings() function performs a faulty nonce validation check, making the reset operation insecure and susceptible to unauthorized access.",
