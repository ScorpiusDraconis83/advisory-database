  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js, specifically affecting the handling of drive names in the Windows environment. Certain Node.js functions do not treat drive names as special on Windows. As a result, although Node.js assumes a relative path, it actually refers to the root directory.\n\nOn Windows, a path that does not start with the file separator is treated as relative to the current directory. \n\nThis vulnerability affects Windows users of `path.join` API.",
