  "details": "JATOS 3.9.4 contains a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability in the authentication system, where an attacker can prevent legitimate users from accessing their accounts by repeatedly sending multiple failed login attempts. Specifically, by submitting 3 incorrect login attempts every minute, the attacker can trigger the account lockout mechanism on the account level, effectively locking the user out indefinitely. Since the lockout is applied to the user account and not based on the IP address, any attacker can trigger the lockout on any user account, regardless of their privileges.",
