  "details": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nworkqueue: Do not warn when cancelling WQ_MEM_RECLAIM work from !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM worker\n\nAfter commit\n746ae46c1113 (\"drm/sched: Mark scheduler work queues with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM\")\namdgpu started seeing the following warning:\n\n [ ] workqueue: WQ_MEM_RECLAIM sdma0:drm_sched_run_job_work [gpu_sched] is flushing !WQ_MEM_RECLAIM events:amdgpu_device_delay_enable_gfx_off [amdgpu]\n...\n [ ] Workqueue: sdma0 drm_sched_run_job_work [gpu_sched]\n...\n [ ] Call Trace:\n [ ]  <TASK>\n...\n [ ]  ? check_flush_dependency+0xf5/0x110\n...\n [ ]  cancel_delayed_work_sync+0x6e/0x80\n [ ]  amdgpu_gfx_off_ctrl+0xab/0x140 [amdgpu]\n [ ]  amdgpu_ring_alloc+0x40/0x50 [amdgpu]\n [ ]  amdgpu_ib_schedule+0xf4/0x810 [amdgpu]\n [ ]  ? drm_sched_run_job_work+0x22c/0x430 [gpu_sched]\n [ ]  amdgpu_job_run+0xaa/0x1f0 [amdgpu]\n [ ]  drm_sched_run_job_work+0x257/0x430 [gpu_sched]\n [ ]  process_one_work+0x217/0x720\n...\n [ ]  </TASK>\n\nThe intent of the verifcation done in check_flush_depedency is to ensure\nforward progress during memory reclaim, by flagging cases when either a\nmemory reclaim process, or a memory reclaim work item is flushed from a\ncontext not marked as memory reclaim safe.\n\nThis is correct when flushing, but when called from the\ncancel(_delayed)_work_sync() paths it is a false positive because work is\neither already running, or will not be running at all. Therefore\ncancelling it is safe and we can relax the warning criteria by letting the\nhelper know of the calling context.\n\nReferences: 746ae46c1113 (\"drm/sched: Mark scheduler work queues with WQ_MEM_RECLAIM\")",
