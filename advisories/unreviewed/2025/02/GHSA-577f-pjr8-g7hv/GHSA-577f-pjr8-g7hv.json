  "details": "The Option Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in version 1.0. This is due to missing nonce validation on the plugin_page() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the WordPress site via a forged request, granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. This can be leveraged to update the default role for registration to administrator and enable user registration for attackers to gain administrative user access to a vulnerable site.",
