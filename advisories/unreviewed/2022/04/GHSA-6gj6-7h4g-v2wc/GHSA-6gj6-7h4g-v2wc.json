  "details": "A vulnerability in IP ingress packet processing of the Cisco Embedded Wireless Controller with Catalyst Access Points Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The device may experience a performance degradation in traffic processing or high CPU usage prior to the unexpected reload. This vulnerability is due to improper rate limiting of IP packets to the management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream of IP traffic at a high rate to the management interface of the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.",
