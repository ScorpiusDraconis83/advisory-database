  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC CFU DIQ (All versions), SIMATIC CFU PA (All versions), SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V2.0.0), SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-400 H V6 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V6.0.10), SIMATIC S7-400 PN/DP V7 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-410 V10 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC S7-410 V8 CPU family (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions), SIMATIC TDC CP51M1 (All versions), SIMATIC TDC CPU555 (All versions), SIMATIC WinAC RTX (All versions), SIMIT Simulation Platform (All versions). The PROFINET (PNIO) stack, when integrated with the Interniche IP stack, improperly handles internal resources for TCP segments where the minimum TCP-Header length is less than defined. This could allow an attacker to create a denial of service condition for TCP services on affected devices by sending specially crafted TCP segments.",
