Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in IBM Lotus Notes R6 and Domino R6, and possibly earlier versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML via square brackets at the beginning and end of (1) computed for display, (2) computed when composed, or (3) computed text element fields.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that it is not a problem with Notes/Domino itself, but with the applications that do not properly handle this feature.",
