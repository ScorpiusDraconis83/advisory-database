  "details": "An Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued execution of this command might cause a sustained Denial of Service condition. If BGP rib sharding is configured and a certain CLI command is executed the rpd process can crash. During the rpd crash and restart, the routing protocols might be impacted and traffic disruption might be seen due to the loss of routing information. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-EVO; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-EVO. This issue does not affect: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 20.3R1. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.3R1-EVO.",
