  ],
  "details": "Various TCP/IP stacks and network applications allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by flooding a target host with TCP connection attempts and completing the TCP/IP handshake without maintaining the connection state on the attacker host, aka the \"NAPTHA\" class of vulnerabilities.  NOTE: this candidate may change significantly as the security community discusses the technical nature of NAPTHA and learns more about the affected applications. This candidate is at a higher level of abstraction than is typical for CVE.",
