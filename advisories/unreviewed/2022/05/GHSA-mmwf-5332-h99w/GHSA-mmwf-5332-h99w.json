  "details": "A vulnerability in the Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing CMP management packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious CMP management packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the switch to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. The switch will reload automatically.",
