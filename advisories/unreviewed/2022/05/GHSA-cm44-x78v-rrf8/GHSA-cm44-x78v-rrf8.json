  "details": "In Android before 2018-04-05 or earlier security patch level on Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SD 210/SD 212/SD 205, SD 410/12, SD 425, SD 427, SD 430, SD 435, SD 450, SD 615/16/SD 415, SD 617, SD 625, SD 650/52, SD 808, SD 810, SD 820, SD 835, SD 845, SDM630, SDM636, SDM660, SDX20, and Snapdragon_High_Med_2016, the 'proper' solution for this will be to ensure that any users of qsee_log in the bootchain (before Linux boots) unallocate their buffers and clear the qsee_log pointer. Until support for that is implemented in TZ and the bootloader, enable tz_log to avoid potential scribbling. This solution will prevent the linux kernel memory corruption.",
