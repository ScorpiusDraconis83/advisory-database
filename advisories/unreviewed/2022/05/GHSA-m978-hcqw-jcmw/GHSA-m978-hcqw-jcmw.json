  "details": "An issue was discovered in chat.php in LiveZilla Live Chat 8.0.1.3 (Helpdesk). A blind JavaScript injection lies in the name parameter. Triggering this can fetch the username and passwords of the helpdesk employees in the URI. This leads to a privilege escalation, from unauthenticated to user-level access, leading to full account takeover. The attack fetches multiple credentials because they are stored in the database (stored XSS). This affects the mobile/chat URI via the lgn and psswrd parameters.",
