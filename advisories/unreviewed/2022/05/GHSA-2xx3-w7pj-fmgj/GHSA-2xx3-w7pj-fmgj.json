  "details": "The BestWebSoft Htaccess plugin through 1.8.1 for WordPress allows wp-admin/admin.php?page=htaccess.php&action=htaccess_editor CSRF. The flag htccss_nonce_name passes the nonce to WordPress but the plugin does not validate it correctly, resulting in a wrong implementation of anti-CSRF protection. In this way, an attacker is able to direct the victim to a malicious web page that modifies the .htaccess file, and takes control of the website.",
