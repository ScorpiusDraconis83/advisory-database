  "details": "Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 9.0.1.5 FIPS+, 9.2.0.8, 9.2.0.8DV, 10.1.0.5, and 10.2.0.3 have unknown impact and remote unauthenticated or authenticated attack vectors related to (1) SYS.DBMS_AQ in the Advanced Queuing component, aka DB01; (2) Core RDBMS, aka DB03; (3) SDO_GEOM in Oracle Spatial, aka DB06; (4) Export, aka DB12; and (5) DBMS_STATS in Query Optimizer, aka DB13.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the Oracle CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that DB06 is SQL injection, and DB13 occurs when the OUTLN account is reset to use a hard-coded password.",
