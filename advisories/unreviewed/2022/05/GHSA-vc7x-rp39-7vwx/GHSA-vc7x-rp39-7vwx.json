  "details": "In the Linux kernel before 5.0.15, the function do_hidp_sock_ioctl in net/bluetooth/hidp/sock.c does not ensure that a certain device field ends with a '\\0' character, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory, or cause a denial of service, which is similar to CVE-2011-1079. The user would use an HIDPCONNADD command.",
