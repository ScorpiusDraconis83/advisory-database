  "details": "Universal Robots control box CB 3.1 across firmware versions (tested on 1.12.1, 1.12, 1.11 and 1.10) does not encrypt or protect in any way the intellectual property artifacts installed from the UR+ platform of hardware and software components (URCaps). These files (*.urcaps) are stored under '/root/.urcaps' as plain zip files containing all the logic to add functionality to the UR3, UR5 and UR10 robots. This flaw allows attackers with access to the robot or the robot network (while in combination with other flaws) to retrieve and easily exfiltrate all installed intellectual property.",
