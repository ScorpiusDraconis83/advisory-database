  "details": "Details The certificate used to identify the Silver Peak Cloud Portal to EdgeConnect devices is not validated. This makes it possible for someone to establish a TLS connection from EdgeConnect to an untrusted portal. Product affected All versions affected prior to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.2+, 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+ Silver Peak Products Applicability Unity EdgeConnect, NX, VX Applicable Unity Orchestrator Applicable EdgeConnect in AWS, Azure, GCP Applicable Silver Peak Cloud Services Not Applicable Resolution • Changes have been made to strengthen the initial exchange between the EdgeConnect appliance and the Cloud Portal. After the changes, EdgeConnect will validate the certificate used to identify the Silver Peak Cloud Portal to EdgeConnect. • TLS itself is continually subject to newly discovered and exploitable vulnerabilities. As such, all versions of EdgeConnect software implement additional out-of-band and user-controlled authentication mechanisms. Any required configuration • Do not change Cloud Portal’s IP address as discovered by the EdgeConnect appliance. • Upgrade to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.2+ or 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+. • In Orchestrator, enable the “Verify Portal Certificate” option under Advanced Security Settings.",
