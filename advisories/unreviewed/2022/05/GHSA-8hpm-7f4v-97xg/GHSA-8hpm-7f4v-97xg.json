  ],
  "details": "An issue was discovered in Istio 1.3 through 1.3.6. Under certain circumstances, it is possible to bypass a specifically configured Mixer policy. Istio-proxy accepts the x-istio-attributes header at ingress that can be used to affect policy decisions when Mixer policy selectively applies to a source equal to ingress. To exploit this vulnerability, someone has to encode a source.uid in this header. This feature is disabled by default in Istio 1.3 and 1.4.",
