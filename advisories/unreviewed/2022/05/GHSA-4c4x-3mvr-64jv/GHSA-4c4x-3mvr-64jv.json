  ],
  "details": "The custom GINA/CP module in ANIXIS Password Reset Client before version 3.22 allows remote attackers to execute code and escalate privileges via spoofing. When the client is configured to use HTTP, it does not authenticate the intended server before opening a browser window. An unauthenticated attacker capable of conducting a spoofing attack can redirect the browser to gain execution in the context of the WinLogon.exe process. If Network Level Authentication is not enforced, the vulnerability can be exploited via RDP.",
