  "details": "An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker to inject a specific BGP update, causing the routing protocol daemon (RPD) to crash and restart, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of the BGP update will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects very specific versions of Juniper Networks Junos OS: 19.3R3-S2; 19.4R3-S3; 20.2 versions 20.2R2-S3 and later, prior to 20.2R3-S2; 20.3 versions 20.3R2 and later, prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions 20.4R2 and later, prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2.
