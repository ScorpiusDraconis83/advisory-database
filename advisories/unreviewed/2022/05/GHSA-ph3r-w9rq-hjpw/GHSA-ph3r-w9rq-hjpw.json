  "details": "Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the AXIS 2100 Network Camera 2.02 with firmware 2.43 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the PATH_INFO to the default URI associated with a directory, as demonstrated by (a) the root directory and (b) the view/ directory; (2) parameters associated with saved settings, as demonstrated by (c) the conf_Network_HostName parameter on the Network page and (d) the conf_Layout_OwnTitle parameter to ServerManager.srv; and (3) the query string to ServerManager.srv, which is displayed on the logs page. NOTE: an attacker can leverage a CSRF vulnerability to modify saved settings.",
