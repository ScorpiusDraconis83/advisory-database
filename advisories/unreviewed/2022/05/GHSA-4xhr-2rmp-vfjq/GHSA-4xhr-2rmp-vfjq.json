  "details": "** DISPUTED ** Squid 3.1.9 allows remote attackers to bypass the access configuration for the CONNECT method by providing an arbitrary allowed hostname in the Host HTTP header.  NOTE: this issue might not be reproducible, because the researcher is unable to provide a squid.conf file for a vulnerable system, and the observed behavior is consistent with a squid.conf file that was (perhaps inadvertently) designed to allow access based on a \"req_header Host\" acl regex that matches www.uol.com.br.",
