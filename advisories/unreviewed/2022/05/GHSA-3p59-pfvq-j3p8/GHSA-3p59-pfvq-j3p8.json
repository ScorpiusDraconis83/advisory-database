  "details": "Delta PMSoft versions 2.10 and prior have multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities where a .ppm file can introduce a value larger than is readable by PMSoft's fixed-length stack buffer. This can cause the buffer to be overwritten, which may allow arbitrary code execution or cause the application to crash. CVSS v3 base score: 7.1; CVSS vector string: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H. Delta Electronics recommends affected users update to at least PMSoft v2.11, which was made available as of March 22, 2018, or the latest available version.",
