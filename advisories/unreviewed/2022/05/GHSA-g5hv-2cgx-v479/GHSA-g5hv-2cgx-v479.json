The Polarion subversion web application does not filter user input in a way that prevents Cross-Site Scripting. If a user is enticed into passing specially crafted, malicious input to the web client (e.g. by clicking on a malicious URL with embedded JavaScript), then JavaScript code can be returned and may then be executed by the userâ€™s client. Various actions could be triggered by running malicious JavaScript code.",
