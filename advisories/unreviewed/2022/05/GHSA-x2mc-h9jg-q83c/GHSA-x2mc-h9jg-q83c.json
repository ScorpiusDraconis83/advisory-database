  "details": "An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The code for parsing the hop-by-hop IPv6 extension headers does not validate the bounds of the extension header length value, which may result in Integer Wraparound. Therefore, a crafted extension header length value may cause Denial-of-Service because it affects the loop in which the extension headers are parsed in pico_ipv6_process_hopbyhop() in pico_ipv6.c.",
