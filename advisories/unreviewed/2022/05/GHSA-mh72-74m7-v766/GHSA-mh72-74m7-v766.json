  "details": "A vulnerability in the shared library loading mechanism of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux and Mac OS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a shared library hijacking attack on an affected device if the VPN Posture (HostScan) Module is installed on the AnyConnect client. This vulnerability is due to a race condition in the signature verification process for shared library files that are loaded on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of crafted interprocess communication (IPC) messages to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have a valid account on the system.",
