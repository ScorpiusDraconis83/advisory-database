  "details": "In Avast Antivirus before 19.4, a local administrator can trick the product into renaming arbitrary files by replacing the Logs\\Update.log file with a symlink. The next time the product attempts to write to the log file, the target of the symlink is renamed. This defect can be exploited to rename a critical product file (e.g., AvastSvc.exe), causing the product to fail to start on the next system restart.",
