  ],
  "details": "In multiple Tecson Tankspion and GOKs SmartBox 4 products the affected application doesn't properly restrict access to an endpoint that is responsible for saving settings, to a unauthenticated user with limited access rights. Based on the lack of adequately implemented access-control rules, by accessing a specific uniform resource locator (URL) on the web server, a malicious user is able to change the application settings without authenticating at all, which violates originally laid ACL rules.",
