  "details": "Emissary-Ingress (formerly Ambassador API Gateway) through 1.13.9 allows attackers to bypass client certificate requirements (i.e., mTLS cert_required) on backend upstreams when more than one TLSContext is defined and at least one configuration exists that does not require client certificate authentication. The attacker must send an SNI specifying an unprotected backend and an HTTP Host header specifying a protected backend.",
