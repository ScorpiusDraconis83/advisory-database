  "details": "An exploitable double-free vulnerability exists in the JavaScript implementation of Nitro Pro PDF. A specially crafted document can cause a reference to a timeout object to be stored in two different places. When closed, the document will result in the reference being released twice. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.",
