  "details": "Argument injection vulnerability in the chromehtml: protocol handler in Google Chrome before 1.0.154.59, when invoked by Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to determine the existence of files, and open tabs for URLs that do not satisfy the IsWebSafeScheme restriction, via a web page that sets document.location to a chromehtml: value, as demonstrated by use of a (1) javascript: or (2) data: URL.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for Universal XSS by exploiting certain behavior involving persistence across page transitions.",
