  "details": "A vulnerability in the Ethernet packet handling of Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs) Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting as a wired client to the Ethernet interface of an affected device and sending a series of specific packets within a short time frame. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a NULL pointer access that results in a reload of the affected device.",
