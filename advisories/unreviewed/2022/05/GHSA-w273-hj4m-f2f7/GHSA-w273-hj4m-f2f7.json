  "details": "Incorrect access control in push notification service in Night Owl Smart Doorbell FW version 20190505 allows remote users to send push notification events via an exposed PNS server. A remote attacker can passively record push notification events which are sent over an insecure web request. The web service does not authenticate requests, and allows attackers to send an indefinite amount of motion or doorbell events to a user's mobile application by either replaying or deliberately crafting false events.",
