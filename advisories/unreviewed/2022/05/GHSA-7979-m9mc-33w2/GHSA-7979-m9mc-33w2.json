  "details": "** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Hinton Design phpht Topsites allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the phpht_real_path parameter to (1) index.php, (2) certain other scripts in the top-level directory, and (3) certain scripts in the admin/ directory.  NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability because $phpht_real_path is defined before use in index.php and most other files except common.php, which is already covered by CVE-2006-5458.",
