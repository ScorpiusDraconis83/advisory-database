  "details": "A cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is used during authentication to the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS web interface.

This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.19; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.10; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.4.
