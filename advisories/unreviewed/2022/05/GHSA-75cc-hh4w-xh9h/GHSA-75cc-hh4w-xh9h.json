  "details": "A vulnerability in the SM-1T3/E3 firmware on Cisco Second Generation Integrated Services Routers (ISR G2) and the Cisco 4451-X Integrated Services Router (ISR4451-X) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by first connecting to the SM-1T3/E3 module console and entering a string sequence. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ISR G2 Router or the SM-1T3/E3 module on the ISR4451-X to reload, resulting in a DoS condition on an affected device.",
