Affected Open Network Bridges store user credentials for the authentication between ONVIF clients and ONVIF server using a hard-coded key. The encrypted credentials can be retrieved via the MIP SDK. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to retrieve and decrypt all credentials stored on the ONVIF server.",
