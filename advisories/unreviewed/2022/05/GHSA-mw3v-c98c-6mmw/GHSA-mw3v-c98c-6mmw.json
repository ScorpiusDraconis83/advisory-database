  "details": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers with firmware 1.0.4.84_10.0.58. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the acsd service, which listens on TCP port 5916 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the admin user. Was ZDI-CAN-9853.",
