  "details": "An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric ME-RTU devices through 2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. Undocumented hard-coded user passwords for root, ineaadmin, mitsadmin, and maint could allow an attacker to gain unauthorised access to the RTU. (Also, the accounts ineaadmin and mitsadmin are able to escalate privileges to root without supplying a password due to insecure entries in /etc/sudoers on the RTU.)",
