  "details": "The Coolpad Defiant device with a build fingerprint of Coolpad/cp3632a/cp3632a:7.1.1/NMF26F/099480857:user/release-keys, the ZTE ZMAX Pro with a build fingerprint of ZTE/P895T20/urd:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170418.114928:user/release-keys, and the T-Mobile Revvl Plus with a build fingerprint of Coolpad/alchemy/alchemy:7.1.1/143.14.171129.3701A-TMO/buildf_nj_02-206:user/release-keys all contain a vulnerable, pre-installed Rich Communication Services (RCS) app. These devices contain an that app has a package name of com.suntek.mway.rcs.app.service (versionCode=1, versionName=RCS_sdk_M_native_20161008_01; versionCode=1, versionName=RCS_sdk_M_native_20170406_01) with a broadcast receiver app component named com.suntek.mway.rcs.app.test.TestReceiver and a refactored version of the app with a package name of com.rcs.gsma.na.sdk (versionCode=1, versionName=RCS_SDK_20170804_01) with a broadcast receiver app component named com.rcs.gsma.na.test.TestReceiver allow any app co-located on the device to programmatically send text messages where the number and body of the text message is controlled by the attacker due to an exported broadcast receiver app component. This app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. A separate vulnerability in the app allows a zero-permission app to programmatically delete text messages, so the sent text messages can be removed to not alert the user.",
