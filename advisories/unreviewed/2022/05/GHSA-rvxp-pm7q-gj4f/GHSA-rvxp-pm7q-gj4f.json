  "details": "WebVPN on the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) device with software 8.0(4), 8.1.2, and 8.2.1 does not properly distinguish its own login screen from the login screens it produces for third-party (1) FTP and (2) CIFS servers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into sending WebVPN credentials to an arbitrary server via a URL associated with that server, aka Bug ID CSCsy80709.",
