  ],
  "details": "Electric Sheep 2.6.3 does not require authentication or integrity checks from the server to the client, which allows remote attackers to download and display arbitrary MPEG movie files via (1) DNS spoofing, (2) a URL on the command line, or (3) a URL in the configuration file. NOTE: the same attack vectors apply to common web browsers that are able to communicate with untrusted web servers, and other problems related to DNS design issues.  Therefore this may not be a specific vulnerability.  However, a client would reasonably expect to receive content only from the server.",
