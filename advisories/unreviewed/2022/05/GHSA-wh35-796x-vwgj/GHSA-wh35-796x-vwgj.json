  "details": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to delete arbitrary files on affected installations of Parallels Desktop 16.1.1-49141. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the Toolgate component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-12129.",
