  "details": "A vulnerability in the TCP throttling process of Cisco UCS C-Series Rack Servers 3.0(0.234) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient rate-limiting protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of TCP SYN packets to a specific TCP listening port on an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a specific TCP listening port to stop accepting new connections, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva65544.",
