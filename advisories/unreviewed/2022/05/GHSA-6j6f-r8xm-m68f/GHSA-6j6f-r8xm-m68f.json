  "details": "A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center web interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity of the system by executing a Document Object Model (DOM)-based, environment or client-side cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability occurs because user-supplied data in the DOM input is not validated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious DOM statements to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to affect the integrity of the system by manipulating the database. Known Affected Releases 11.0(1)ES10. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf18325.",
