  "details": "MX Player Android App versions prior to v1.24.5, are vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when user is using the MX Transfer feature in \"Receive\" mode. An attacker can exploit this by connecting to the MX Transfer session as a \"sender\" and sending a MessageType of \"FILE_LIST\" with a \"name\" field containing directory traversal characters (../). This will result in the file being transferred to the victim's phone, but being saved outside of the intended \"/sdcard/MXshare\" directory. In some instances, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by writing \".odex\" and \".vdex\" files in the \"oat\" directory of the MX Player application.",
