  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack on an affected device. The attacker would require valid device credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the HTTPS URL by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTPS request that contains directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the device.",
