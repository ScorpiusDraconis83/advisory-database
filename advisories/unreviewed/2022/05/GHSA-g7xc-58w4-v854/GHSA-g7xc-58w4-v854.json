  "details": "a. IPSec UDP key material can be retrieved from machine-to-machine interfaces and human-accessible interfaces by a user with admin credentials. Such a user, with the required system knowledge, could use this material to decrypt in-flight communication. b. The vulnerability requires administrative access and shell access to the EdgeConnect appliance. An admin user can access IPSec seed and nonce parameters using the CLI, REST APIs, and the Linux shell. Resolution • EdgeConnect software has been modified to prevent users from accessing IPSec seed and nonce parameters using the CLI, REST APIs, and the Linux shell. • EdgeConnect software has been modified to allow customers to choose not to persist the IPSec seed for additional security. Any required configuration Upgrade to Silver Peak Unity ECOS™ 8.3.2+ or 8.1.9.12+ and Silver Peak Unity Orchestrator™ 8.9.2+. 8.
