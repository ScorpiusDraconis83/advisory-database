  "details": "An arbitrary memory overwrite vulnerability in Asylo versions up to 0.6.0 allows an attacker to make a host call to UntrustedCall. UntrustedCall failed to validate the buffer range within sgx_params and allowed the host to return a pointer that was an address within the enclave memory. This allowed an attacker to read memory values from within the enclave.",
