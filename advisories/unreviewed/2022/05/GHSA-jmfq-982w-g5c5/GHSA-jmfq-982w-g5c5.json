  "details": "The SSH key generation process in OpenSSH in Apple Mac OS X 10.3.9 and 10.4 through 10.4.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by connecting to the server before SSH has finished creating keys, which causes the keys to be regenerated and can break trust relationships that were based on the original keys.",
