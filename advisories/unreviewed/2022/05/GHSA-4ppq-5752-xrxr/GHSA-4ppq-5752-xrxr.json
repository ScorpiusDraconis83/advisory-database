  "details": "A vulnerability in the REST API of the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE 3.1 through 16.5 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication to the REST API of the web UI of the affected software. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for the REST API of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious API request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the web UI of the affected software. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the HTTP Server feature is enabled for the device. The newly redesigned, web-based administration UI was introduced in the Denali 16.2 Release of Cisco IOS XE Software. This vulnerability does not affect the web-based administration UI in earlier releases of Cisco IOS XE Software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCuz46036.",
