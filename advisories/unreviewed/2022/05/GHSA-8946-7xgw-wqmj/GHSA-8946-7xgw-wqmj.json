  "details": "In the Pro and Enterprise versions of GTranslate < 2.8.65, the gtranslate_request_uri_var function runs at the top of all pages and echoes out the contents of $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']. Although this uses addslashes, and most modern browsers automatically URLencode requests, this plugin is still vulnerable to Reflected XSS in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 or below, or in cases where an attacker is able to modify the request en route between the client and the server, or in cases where the user is using an atypical browsing solution.",
