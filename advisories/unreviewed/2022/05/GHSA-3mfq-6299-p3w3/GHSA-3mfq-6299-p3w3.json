  "details": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of MIDI (kernel 5.7-rc6), where an attacker with a local account and the permissions to issue an ioctl commands to midi devices, could trigger a use-after-free. A write to this specific memory while freed and before use could cause the flow of execution to change and possibly allow for memory corruption or privilege escalation.",
