  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco DNA Spaces Connector could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underling operating system with privileges of the web-based management application, which is running as a restricted user. This could result in changes being made to pages served by the web-based management application impacting the integrity or availability of the web-based management application.",
