  "details": "A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) security services of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect memory operations that the affected software performs when the software parses a username during login authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device or cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running Cisco IOS XE Software Release Fuji 16.7.1 or Fuji 16.8.1 and are configured to use AAA for login authentication. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvi25380.",
