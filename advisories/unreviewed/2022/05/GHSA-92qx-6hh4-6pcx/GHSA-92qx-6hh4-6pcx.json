  "details": "An issue was discovered in Open-Xchange OX App Suite before 7.8.2-rev8. Setting the user's name to JS code makes that code execute when selecting that user's \"Templates\" folder from OX Documents settings. This requires the folder to be shared to the victim. Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context. This can lead to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (sending mail, deleting data etc.).",
