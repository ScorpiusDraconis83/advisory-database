  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based user interface (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not reset the privilege level for each web UI session. An attacker who has valid credentials for an affected device could exploit this vulnerability by remotely accessing a VTY line to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access an affected device with the privileges of the user who previously logged in to the web UI. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software, if the HTTP Server feature is enabled and authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) authorization is not configured for EXEC sessions. The default state of the HTTP Server feature is version-dependent. This vulnerability was introduced in Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.1.1. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf71769.",
