  "details": "A vulnerability in the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) single sign-on (SSO) interface of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information. Version 12.5 is affected.",
