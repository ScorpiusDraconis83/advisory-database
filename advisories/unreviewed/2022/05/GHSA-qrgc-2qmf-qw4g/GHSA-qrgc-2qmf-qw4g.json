  "details": "A vulnerability in the Fanuc i Series CNC (0i-MD and 0i Mate-MD) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected CNC to become inaccessible to other devices. The vulnerability is due to improper design or implementation of the Ethernet communication modules of the CNC. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of malformed packets to port 8193/tcp, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition, where the affected device would require a manual power cycle of the CNC to recover.",
