  "details": "An issue was discovered in D-Link 'myDlink Baby App' version 2.04.06. Whenever actions are performed from the app (e.g., change camera settings or play lullabies), it communicates directly with the Wi-Fi camera (D-Link 825L firmware 1.08) with the credentials (username and password) in base64 cleartext. An attacker could conduct an MitM attack on the local network and very easily obtain these credentials.",
