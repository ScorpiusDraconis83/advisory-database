  "details": "Ballistix MOD Utility through 2.0.2.5 is vulnerable to privilege escalation in the MODAPI.sys driver component. The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific IOCTL request that allows low-privileged users to directly interact with physical memory via the MmMapIoSpace function call (mapping physical memory into a virtual address space). Attackers could exploit this issue to achieve local privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.",
