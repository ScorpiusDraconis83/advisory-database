  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in SINEC NMS (All versions < V1.0 SP1 Update 1), SINEMA Server (All versions < V14.0 SP2 Update 2). When uploading files to an affected system using a zip container, the system does not correctly check if the relative file path of the extracted files is still within the intended target directory. With this an attacker could create or overwrite arbitrary files on an affected system. This type of vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'. (ZDI-CAN-12054)",
