  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All Versions < V13.1.0), Solid Edge (All Versions < SE2021MP2), Teamcenter Visualization (All Versions < V13.1.0). Affected applications lack proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PAR files. This can result in an out of bounds write past the memory location that is a read only image address. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
