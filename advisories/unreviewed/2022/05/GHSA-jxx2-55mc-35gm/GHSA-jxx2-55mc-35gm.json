The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a targeted user to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to send arbitrary requests that could change the password of a targeted user. An attacker could then take unauthorized actions on behalf of the targeted user.",
