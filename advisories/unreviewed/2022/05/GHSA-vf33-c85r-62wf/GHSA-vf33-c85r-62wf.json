  "details": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the column element (includes/elements/column.php) accepts an â€˜html_tagâ€™ parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified â€˜save_builderâ€™ request containing JavaScript in the â€˜html_tagâ€™ parameter, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
