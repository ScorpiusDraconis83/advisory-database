  "details": "A vulnerability in the web-based GUI of Cisco UCS Director 6.0.0.0 and 6.0.0.1 could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary workflow items with just an end-user profile, a Privilege Escalation Vulnerability. The vulnerability is due to improper role-based access control (RBAC) after the Developer Menu is enabled in Cisco UCS Director. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling Developer Mode for his/her user profile with an end-user profile and then adding new catalogs with arbitrary workflow items to his/her profile. An exploit could allow an attacker to perform any actions defined by these workflow items, including actions affecting other tenants. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvb64765.",
