  "details": "A DLL side loading vulnerability in the Windows Service in TeamViewer versions up to 11.0.133222 (fixed in 11.0.214397), 12.0.181268 (fixed in 12.0.214399), 13.2.36215 (fixed in 13.2.36216), and 14.6.4835 (fixed in 14.7.1965) on Windows could allow an attacker to perform code execution on a target system via a service restart where the DLL was previously installed with administrative privileges. Exploitation requires that an attacker be able to create a new file in the TeamViewer application directory; directory permissions restrict that by default.",
