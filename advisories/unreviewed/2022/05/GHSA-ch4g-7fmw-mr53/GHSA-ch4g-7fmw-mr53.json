The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) function of the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted CSR in the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow an attacker with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the device with full root privileges.",
