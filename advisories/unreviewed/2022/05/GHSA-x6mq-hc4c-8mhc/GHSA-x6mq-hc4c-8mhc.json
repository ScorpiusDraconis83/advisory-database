  "details": "An issue was discovered in Avaya one-X Portal for IP Office 9.1.2.0 and prior. The DownloadToLocalDriveServlet function from the AFA portal is only intended to download backup ZIP files from the server to the operator desktop; however, a malicious user capable of intercepting the HTTP request would be able to modify folder and filename parameters in order to get access to any file on the underlying operating system, as demonstrated by a folder=/etc/&filename=passwd query string. Additionally it could cause a DoS, as this functions also implements file deletion after downloading.",
