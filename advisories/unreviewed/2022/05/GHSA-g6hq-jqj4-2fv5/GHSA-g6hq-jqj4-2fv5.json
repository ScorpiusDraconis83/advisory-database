  "details": "Junos OS routing protocol daemon (RPD) process may crash and restart or may lead to remote code execution while processing specific BGP NOTIFICATION messages. By continuously sending crafted BGP NOTIFICATION messages, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a sustained Denial of Service. Due to design improvements, this issue does not affect Junos OS 16.1R1, and all subsequent releases. This issue only affects the receiving BGP device and is non-transitive in nature. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1F5 versions starting from 15.1F5-S7 and all subsequent releases; 15.1F6 versions starting from 15.1F6-S3 and later releases prior to 15.1F6-S10; 15.1F7 versions 15.1 versions starting from 15.1R5 and later releases, including the Service Releases based on 15.1R5 and on 15.1R6 prior to 15.1R6-S6 and 15.1R7;",
