  "details": "A vulnerability has been identified in Nucleus NET (All versions < V5.2), Nucleus ReadyStart for ARM, MIPS, and PPC (All versions < V2012.12). Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs) for TCP connections are derived from an insufficiently random source. As a result, the ISN of current and future TCP connections could be predictable. An attacker could hijack existing sessions or spoof future ones.",
