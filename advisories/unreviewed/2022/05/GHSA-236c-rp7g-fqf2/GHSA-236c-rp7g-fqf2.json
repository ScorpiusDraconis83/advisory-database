  "details": "A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the NX-API on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the NX-API to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. The attacker could view and modify the device configuration. Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.",
