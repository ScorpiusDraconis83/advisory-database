  "details": "\n A vulnerability in the logging subsystem of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information in a system log file that should be restricted.\n The vulnerability exists because sensitive information is not properly masked before it is written to system log files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to an affected device and inspecting a specific system log file. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in the system log file. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid user credentials.\n ",
