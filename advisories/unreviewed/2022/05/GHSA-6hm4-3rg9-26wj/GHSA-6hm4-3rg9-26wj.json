  "details": "The administrative interface (aka DkService.exe) in Diskeeper 9 Professional, 2007 Pro Premier, and probably other versions exposes a memory comparison function via RPC over TCP, which allows remote attackers to (1) obtain sensitive information (process memory contents), as demonstrated by an attack that obtains module base addresses to defeat Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR); or (2) cause a denial of service (application crash) via an out-of-bounds address.",
