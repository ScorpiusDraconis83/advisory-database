  "details": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found on Western Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo, and SanDisk ibi that could allow an attacker accessing the system locally to read information from /etc/version file. This vulnerability can only be exploited by chaining it with another issue. If an attacker is able to carry out a remote code execution attack, they can gain access to the vulnerable file, due to the presence of insecure functions in code. User interaction is required for exploitation. Exploiting the vulnerability could result in exposure of information, ability to modify files, memory access errors, or system crashes.",
