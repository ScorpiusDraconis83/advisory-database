  "details": "The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution due to the theme allowing site editors to include executable code blocks in website content in versions 1.2 to 1.5.3. This, combined with the missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400), makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, can edit any page, post, or template on the vulnerable WordPress website and inject a code execution block that can be used to achieve remote code execution.",
