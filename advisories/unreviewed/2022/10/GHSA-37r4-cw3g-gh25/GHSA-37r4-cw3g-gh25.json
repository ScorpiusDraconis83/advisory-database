  "details": "An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling and a Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated low privileged attacker to cause a Denial of Sevice (DoS). In a high-scaled BGP routing environment with rib-sharding enabled, two issues may occur when executing a specific CLI command. One is a memory leak issue with rpd where the leak rate is not constant, and the other is a temporary spike in rpd memory usage during command execution. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S2, 21.2R2-S1, 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S1-EVO; 21.1-EVO version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R1-S2-EVO, 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 19.2R1.",
