  "details": "The AnyMind Widget plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.1. This is due to missing nonce protection on the createDOMStructure() function found in the ~/anymind-widget-id.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a siteâ€™s administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
