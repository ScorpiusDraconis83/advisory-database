  "details": "An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows unauthenticated network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). On all Junos Evolved platforms hostbound protocols will be impacted by a high rate of specific hostbound traffic from ports on a PFE. Continued receipt of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.2R1.",
