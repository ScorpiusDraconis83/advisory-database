An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted GRE payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition. https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-gre-dos-hmedHQPM [\"https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-gre-dos-hmedHQPM\"] This advisory is part of the November 2022 release of the Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Security Advisory Bundled publication.",
