  "details": "There is a vulnerability in DHCPv6 packet parsing code that could be explored by remote attacker to craft a packet that could cause buffer overflow in a memcpy call, leading to out-of-bounds memory write that would cause dhcp6relay to crash. Dhcp6relay is a critical process and could cause dhcp relay docker to shutdown. Discovered by Eugene Lim of GovTech Singapore.",
