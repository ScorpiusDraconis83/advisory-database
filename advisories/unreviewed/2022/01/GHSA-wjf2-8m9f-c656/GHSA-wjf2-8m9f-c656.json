  "details": "An incorrect default permission vulnerability exists in the cgiserver.cgi cgi_check_ability functionality of reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102. The SetMdAlarm API sets the movement detection parameters, giving the ability to set the sensitivity of the camera per a range of hours, and which of the camera spaces to ignore when considering movement detection. Because in cgi_check_ability the SetMdAlarm API does not have a specific case, the user permission will default to 7. This will give non-administrative users the possibility to change the movement detection parameters.",
