  "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TeamViewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of TVS files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated structure.
