  "details": "Trendnet AC2600 TEW-827DRU version 2.08B01 does not properly implement csrf protections. Most pages lack proper usage of CSRF protections or mitigations. Additionally, pages that do make use of CSRF tokens are trivially bypassable as the server does not appear to validate them properly (i.e. re-using an old token or finding the token thru some other method is possible).",
