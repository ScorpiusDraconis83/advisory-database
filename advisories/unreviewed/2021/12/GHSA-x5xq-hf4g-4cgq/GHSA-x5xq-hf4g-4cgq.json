  ],
  "details": "The 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image URL after redirects. By embedding an image that triggered authentication flows - in conjunction with a Content Security Policy that stopped a redirection chain in the middle - the final image URL could be one that contained an authentication token used to takeover a user account. If a website tricked a user into copy and pasting the image link back to the page, the page would be able to steal the authentication tokens. This was fixed by making the action return the original URL, before any redirects. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94.",
